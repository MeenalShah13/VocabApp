<h3>Challenges Addressed in Mobile Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Orientation<br />To prevent disruptions caused by orientation changes resetting the instance state and leading to a poor user experience, we opted to lock the app's orientation. This decision enhances ease of use and ensures a consistent and user-friendly interface.</li>
<li>Restoration of data on reinstall<br />To safeguard user progress against app deletion or reinstallation, we implemented a mechanism to synchronize learned words with the cloud at regular intervals (when a network connection is available). This ensures that user data remains intact and accessible across installations.</li>
<li>Integration with Cloud-Based Services<br />We leveraged the Retrofit library to interact seamlessly with cloud-based services. This allows us to retrieve and manipulate data from an open-source, cost-free API, enabling users to fetch word definitions directly from the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monetization Model</h3>
<p>The app will work on a donation model, where interested users will be asked to donate to help with the upkeep and maintenance of the app.</p>
